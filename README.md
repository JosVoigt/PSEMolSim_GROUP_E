## Submissions and Presentations

All the submissions for the individual sheets, the presentation slides and the project documentation is automatically deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://manuellerchner.github.io/MolSim-WS23-24) and can be accessed via the following links:

- The doxygen documentation of the `master` branch can be found in [docs](https://manuellerchner.github.io/MolSim-WS23-24/docs/).
- The submission files of the `presentations` branch can be found in [submissions](https://manuellerchner.github.io/MolSim-WS23-24/submissions/).

## Tools

### Build tools and versions

- Tested with `gcc 13.1.0`
- Tested with `CMake 3.28.0`
- Tested with `make 4.3`

### Dependencies

- Doxygen 1.10.0: `sudo apt install doxygen` (optional, only needed for documentation)
  - Graphviz: `sudo apt install graphviz` (optional, only needed for drawing UML diagrams in doxygen)
- Libxerces 3.2.3: `sudo apt install libxerces-c-dev`
- Boost Program Options: `sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev`
- cmake-format: `sudo apt install cmake-format-13` (optional, only needed for formatting cmake files)

## Build

### Build the project

In this section we describe how to build the project. You can use the following options to configure the build process:

1. Create and enter into the build directory: `mkdir -p build && cd build`
2. Configure the project with cmake:
   - With Doxygen support: `cmake .. -D BUILD_DOC_DOXYGEN=ON`
   - Without Doxygen support: `cmake ..`
3. Build the project
   - Compile project and tests: `make -j`
   - Compile just the project: `make -j MolSim`
   - Compile the tests: `make -j tests`
   - Compile benchmarks: `make -j benchmarks`

>*Hint: The `-j<int>` option enables parallel compilation on the given amount of cores, e.g. `-j4` for 4 cores, if no number is given the maximum amount of cores is used*

### Build the documentation

- Make sure the project is built **with** doxygen enabled.

- Enter the `build` directory after building the project.

- Run `make doc_doxygen` to build the documentation.

- The output can be found in `build/docs/html/index.html`.

- The documentation of the `master` branch can be found [here](https://manuellerchner.github.io/MolSim-WS23-24/docs/).

## Run

### Run the program

- Enter the `build/project` directory after building the project.

- Run `./MolSim <FILENAME>` to run the program. `<FILENAME>` is the path to the input file. For more information on the possible input file formats see [Input File Formats](@ref InputFileFormats).

  - Excecute `./MolSim --help` to get a detailed list of all options, parameters and their default values.

  - An example run could look like this: `./MolSim ../../body_collision.cub -d 0.0002 -e 5`
  
  - Further information about the possible input file formats can be found in the `/docs` directory.
  
    - **Note:** Input files can, and for some cases have to provide own simulation parameters. In case the user provides additional parameters via the command line, both sources of parameters are merged. If a conflict occurs, the command line parameters take precedence, since it was explicitly requested by the user. To avoid mixups, it is recommended to define all parameters in the input file and only use command line for small, temporary adjustments to avoid changing the input file.

### Run the tests

- Enter the `build/tests` directory after building the tests.

- Run `ctest` or `./tests` to run the tests.

### Run the benchmarks

- Enter the `build/benchmarks` directory after building the benchmarks.

- Execute one of the benchmarks. For example: `./2DParticleRect`
