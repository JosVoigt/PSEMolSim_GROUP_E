# libxsd - runtime library for XML Schema to C++ data binding compiler

XSD is an open-source, cross-platform XML Schema to C++ data binding
compiler. Provided with an XML document specification (XML Schema), it
generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as well as XML
parsing and serialization code. You can then access the data stored in XML
using types and functions that semantically correspond to your application
domain rather than dealing with generic elements/attributes and raw strings.

For further information, including licensing conditions, documentation, and
binary packages, refer to the [XSD project
page](https://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/).
